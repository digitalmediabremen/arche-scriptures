## Laser engraving ceramics

The process of creating the laser engraved slabs of ceramics:

1. Make the clay slabs using flatning tool (forgot the name)
2. Put the clays to dry on a flat surface. To make sure that they don't naturally bend, leave a weighted flat object on top of the clay piece.
3. After they are flat enough not to bend any longer, bring them to the laser engraving.
4. The following laser engraving parameters work well for red-clay:
  - X
  - Y
  - Z
5. Bring the lasered clay piece to be fired. In order for the engraving to be uniform across the plate, the heat during the firing process needs to also be more-or-less uniform across the piece.
