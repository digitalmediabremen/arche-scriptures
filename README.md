>"Ancestor + Futurism are two terms that apparently emerge from an impossibility, from the ambivalence between two disparate realms: archaism and future. [...] ancestrofuturism requests concepts that work with other notions of time and resignify the assumed linearity between past and future, i.e., concepts that deconstruct the idea of vertical time and history — from archaism pointing towards the future — and that horizontalize this perspective." - Fabi Borges

Arche-scripture speculates a post-technological state of digital information through an ancestro-futuristic perspective. The laser  engraved ceramics proposes an archaic digital medium, a paradox of  fragility and permanence made tangible and audible. 

The data stored in the ceramic pieces consists of voice recordings extracted from the Pandemic Archive of Voices. In the headphones one can listen to the software attempting to read back the engraved information. The central surviving piece engraves the sound of the word “dalijna”, meaning “distance”.
