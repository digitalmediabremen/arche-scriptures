## Resarch Abstract

Arche-scriptures researches the usage of ceramics as a possible medium for storing of digital information.

## Ancestro-futurism

>"Ancestor + Futurism are two terms that apparently emerge from an impossibility, from the ambivalence between two disparate realms: archaism and future. [...] ancestrofuturism requests concepts that work with other notions of time and resignify the assumed linearity between past and future, i.e., concepts that deconstruct the idea of vertical time and history — from archaism pointing towards the future — and that horizontalize this perspective." - Fabi Borges

## Research

### Abandoned method of Optical Character Recognition

In the initial phase of the research, I attempted to expriment with a system of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in order to store bit data into to plate. With this approach it was expected to have a flexible method which would also be aethetically fitting to aethetics of archeology.

### Laser engraving ceramics

The process of creating the laser engraved slabs of ceramics:

1. Make the clay slabs using flatning tool (forgot the name)
2. Put the clays to dry on a flat surface. To make sure that they don't naturally bend, leave a weighted flat object on top of the clay piece.
3. After they are flat enough not to bend any longer, bring them to the laser engraving.
4. The following laser engraving parameters work well for red-clay:
  - X
  - Y
  - Z
5. Bring the lasered clay piece to be fired. In order for the engraving to be uniform across the plate, the heat during the firing process needs to also be more-or-less uniform across the piece. 

### Encoding the audio data

For the audio file to be encoded into a bit-image that is ready to be laser-engraved, there are multiple steps of conversion, compression and formating that are necessary.

- convert .wav audio file to the minimal compression possible (8bit, 4000 samplerate)
- extract the raw waveform data out of the wavefile
- convert the 8bit numbers into 8 bits of `0` or `1`
- render the bit list into a grid of white and black squared.
- shape the bit grid to the dimentions of the clay piece which will be lasered

There are multiple ways in which this process can be greatly improved, certain approaches are intentionally avoided, such as more "abstract" modes of compression, which would make the data smaller but more fragile.

For cases in which the reading process needs to have a higher level of confidence, redundance of data should be implemented, but that would required a much greater ammount of space for the same ammount of information.

### Abstract

Arche-scripture speculates a post-technological state of digital information through an ancestro-futuristic perspective. The laser  engraved ceramics proposes an archaic digital medium, a paradox of  fragility and permanence made tangible and audible. 

The data stored in the ceramic pieces consists of voice recordings extracted from the Pandemic Archive of Voices. In the headphones one can listen to the software attempting to read back the engraved information. The central surviving piece engraves the sound of the word “dalijna”, meaning “distance”.
